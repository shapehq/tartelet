## üë©‚Äçüíª How can I contribute?

Pull requests with bugfixes and new features are much appreciated. We are happy to review PRs and merge them once they are ready, as long as they contain changes that fit within the vision of Tartelet.

Clone the repository to get started working on the project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shapehq/tartelet.git
```

### Generating a Project File with XcodeGen

After cloning the repository you will notice that the project does not contain a .xcodeproj file. This should be generated using [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen). Install XcodeGen using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

After installing XcodeGen the project file can be generated by running the following command.

```bash
xcodegen generate
```

### Generating Resource Constants with SwiftGen

We use [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) to generate constants for images, colors, and localizations. Install SwiftGen using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
brew install swiftgen
```

Constants for images, colors, and localizations are then generated by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
swiftgen
```

The `swiftgen.yml` file at the root of the repository describes how constants are generated.

### Configuring the project to run on your machine

To run the project locally, it is necessary to edit the `Tartelet.entitlements` file to specify a keychain access group that you control. Then you will need to edit the `Composers.swift` file to ensure the keychain is initialized with the keychain access group specified in the entitlements file. If you do not do this, the app will not be able to persist settings to the keychain.

In other words, you will need to search for `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)dk.shape.Tartelet` and `566MC7D8D4.dk.shape.Tartelet` in the project and replace the occurrences with references to your keychain access group.

### Linting the Codebase with SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure uniformity in the code. Install SwiftLint using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
brew install swiftlint
```
